lust,"The drought kills the thirst
Harvest is a rarity
Dry winds dance in skin deep heat
Leaves abandon trees
Grounds crack in branches
I walk in pain
As needles climb up my feet
My lungs shiver of dryness
My heart pumps like a drum beat
Somewhere under the canopy
Of the velvet sky
A woman in tan
Waving to me
To join her party
Dig and cover
A gravely game
Insecurity permissible
Immaturity formidable
When you incline
Rose isn’t dead yet
But for you to grow them
In a killing field where
Love and lust
Collide
PS:  Love and lust come from the mind.Its all in the mind and from the mind.Heart is only to make love look so nice and beautiful.Heart only function as a generator to supply nutrients and oxygen to our bodies.If the heart stops, we die.Love and lust is a mind game.It will remain in the brain depend on how serious or critical the amount of love that we have recieved.
Remember it takes two to tango.Love can not fly with a single wing."
lust,"Lust is what I speak tonight,
Lust is what I see tonight,
Lust is what I feel tonight,
And I Lust You.
Show me your Body
inside out…
no clothes on,
no holds barred…
bit by bit,
part by part,
give me your smells,
and your sweat…
give me what all you have
every naked bit of yours,
I want to see All of yours.
feel my hands
feel my legs
feel my torso
my body begs…
Come on me
and make me wet
juices flowing…
feel the heat…
together, we’ll
make ‘us’ meet.
If Lust be sin,
So be it…
For I am a Woman,
And you a Man.
How can I love you
and not lust you?
For Me,
Love and Lust,
go hand in hand…
for I am a Woman
and you are my Man."
lust,"He lusts for her
Her apple breasts
Beneath her vest
Taste the best
Lust, Lust, Lust
Three women on the go
Yet happiness does not flow
It is only
Lust, Lust, Lust
Her apple breasts
Beneath her vest
Taste the best
The natural flow of wetness
He hopes to taste once more
Maybe its vanilla flavor
Will be one better than before
Lust, Lust, Lust
Lost in focus
Lost in defense
Can’t do his job
Till he scores once more
Now humble, no longer hardcore
Only suffering from lust hangover
Her apple breast
Beneath her vest
Has just put him to the test
The sweet fluid of sex
Displaying something complex
Lust, Lust, Lust
Save him
He is an emotional wreck
For he still lusts after his Ex!

lust,"Bodies entwined
Hearts resounding
the shivers of sweat
coming and going
Those inhibited places
opening up: slowly, gently,
delicately
losing inhibitions
new sensations
A touch here
and a touch there
smokeless fire!
A miracle invisible
to 'him and her'
Yet to You and Me
engulfed in passion
lustful love or lovable lust?
Let love be there
and lust be too
A heavenly feeling
for me and you
feel yourself and feel me too
Fantasies unfold
dreams come true
Me for You and Only You
just the way you wanted to!"
lust,"I was lost 6 months ago
It was lust that drove my soul
I couldn't controll...
what happened that night
What a loss I say to you
It wasn't love
but why not try something new?
Why judge someone you don't know?
Just open your mind and go with the flow
But no...
You had left so many words unspoken
I have questions, but your mind still isn't open
What a loss I say to you"
lust,"Lust destroyed my love
Lust pushed away my one
Lust made me weak
Lust took the one love
Lust killed my happiness
Lust is a sin I committed
Lust, I shouldn't had done
Lust got my suffocating
Lust made light turn into darkness
Lust made me miss my wife
Lust, my innocent girl is hurt
Lust I hurt myself too
Lust I miss my family I built
Lust, you were my biggest mistake...."
lust,"Enraptured by the mystic starry sky
Vincent so desperately wanted to try,
To paint this enchanting twilight scene,
But how, Colours in that light couldn’t be seen.
He longed to paint on the spot at night,
What he saw, as he saw without artificial light.
‘Night is more richly coloured than day
Putting little white dots on a black surface, no way'
Struck by brilliance of stars on closer attention
And his zest and lust and passion for perfection,
A legend goes in rural areas of south of France,
He put candles in the felt hat to capture and paint.
Thus the locals gave him a name, illumine
French word meaning lit up and delusive.
Couldn’t care less, night to be painted on the spot
Settled for a gas jet after pondering a lot
The painting depicts a religious motif of youth.
To assuage his thirst for the Absolute
‘I just paint nature as it seems to me, complete
All we have to do is unravel the mystery…’
A tribute to Vincent Van Gogh, Impressionist painter, best known for Sun Flowers.
Starry Night is a fascinating work, as is his passion."
lust,"Discontented heart and a restless soul,
unaware i was of my goals.
Alcohol, cocaine, hashish and grass
transformed me to a creature crass.
They pervaded the blood in my veins
squandered me to world obscure,
where enlightenment was feign.
There, euphoria didn't differ from pain.
A drizzle felt like deluge, a whisper like roar.
Where the breeze was a storm,
It was a world with no rules no norms.
When the monsters exited my veins,
my blood burned with fire,
bringing me down the spiral
melting me into an uninsurable mess.
The hallucinatory clouds quickly dissipated
bringing to me, numbness i hardly anticipated.
Such felt the lights glare, i hid from its flair,
surrendered myself to darkness and gloom.
Grappling with questions,
i gave in to the temptation.
They took me to a world so high
far from grievances and sighs.
Little did i know,
my ship struggling to dropp anchor
drifted me away from the shore of my life.
Being a recluse was no longer an excuse.
Empathy, loath, rebuke, resentment
in keeping me company, were all redundant.
From my eyes fell tears of blood,
for i was drowning in a flood.
Helpless one day, i found myself on bed.
My mother's palm gently stroking my forehead.
I was surrounded by moist eyes
all of them wearing an honest disguise,
making me feel i would still find my light,
that my future was shining bright.
Such intense was my lust for life, then.
Death was waiting to stake it's claim on my life, when."
lust,"I don't believe in love, I decided long ago:
that other hearts were summer heat and mine was winter snow
I despised them for their impudence, oh such a long way to go!
I bet myself another life that I would never feel too
What silly girls and silly boys called 'love', their new-
found companionship displayed in sycophantic spew
of words and promises that would change next week.
I thought myself so strong, compared to them so bloody meek
And in every spare debate said as loud as I could speak
'There is no such thing as love'
don't you get it?
Then one day I found myself dreaming, exam half finished beneath me
I couldn't stop imagining your hands on my skin, see?
But it faded when those words escaped your lips, so true it must be
that I am the only one in this stunted world that feels like that.
When dreams flash past I take part,
(Shadows of limbs intertwined I alone would call art) .
It occured to me as daylight, slick and ever bright
Swept away the languid presence, the sloe black, crow black night
Something that had nothing to do with my beating heart. I might
be wrong.
Truth is, I am in lust. Not love, not that patronising knife blade, that ignorant, fetid, unreal stigma, but lust. A real emotion, real, raw and completely deserving of a saint,
a day,
cards that say what we are too polite to,
of songs and books, and precious poems.
Lust is all around, and I'll admit to this:
I'm falling in lust with you,
(just don't quote me on that.)"
lust,"SENUALITY AND LUST
esspeecee …09.06.09
Extramarital affair
Tipsy; I fall-in
Often and
Effortlessly, compulsively.
It’s not lust
To gratify
But douse, drench
In beguiling Sensuality.
A tankard-full
Golden sun ray
Orangish archisap
Sip the sparkle
n’sip
Inebriate become
O Orangish Sensuality.
Smear Sensuality
A fragranced jelly
An intimate togetherness
With fiancée
Sing:
Hulla huh u laa hulla.
Take orangey transfusion
Of Sensuality
All cells are bathed
Melts down lust
Tranquility imbues me.
Lust gyrates, explodes
Repressed gratification surfaces,
Make me
Civilized libidinist.
Sexitation slumber
Under blanket of
Serene Sensuality
Like doped sloth.
I sip the tankard
Frothy, bubbly
Lips in commune with
Softy smoothie Sensuality.
Lust forgive me
Fear your
Grotesque laughter
Boozer of soma.
Lust is concocted
Groomed, vamped
Nudity
Product of civilization.
Sensuality is
Effortless, born-nascent, innate
Nudity
Pre-civilization gleam galore.

O Sensuality
My placid play pal
Stay even short
With me
Endlessly I relish
It’s ‘After-Taste’.
Orangey golden Sensuality
Drink you compulsively
I’m, for ever new
Extramarital affair
Die hard I’m of.

lust,"I care not for my Lady’s soul
Though I worship before her smile;
I care not where be my Lady’s goal
When her beauty shall lose its wile.
Low sit I down at my Lady’s feet
Gazing through her wild eyes
Smiling to think how my love will fleet
When their starlike beauty dies.
I care not if my Lady pray
To our Father which is in Heaven
But for joy my heart’s quick pulses play
For to me her love is given.
Then who shall close my Lady’s eyes
And who shall fold her hands?
Will any hearken if she cries
Up to the unknown lands?"
lust,"Into the dark, dank cellar
I lead you by the hand
towards a marble alter
laid with crimson sheets,
surrounded by cold candles
winking their naked eyes.
I feel you shiver against me
as I gently lay you down,
enter your mind
and read your soul.
You are not, yet, ready
to embrace this open flame.
The dim light flickers,
you fall into my eyes,
softly you sigh my name.
As your will evaporates
I slowly enter your skin
awaiting that first, sweet thrill.
Hot liquid fire burns my lips,
yet warms my heart.
Uncovering your dreams
in each anxious beat
I see your desire for me,
I hear your pain.
Alas, my love,
alone I choose to wander
as warm, pleading hands
chill my blood.
You grow pale now,
all life slips from your eyes
which seem to beg me
to set you free.
Don't cry, my sweet,
I fail to hear that naked plea
over the steady pleasure beat
you have given me.

lust,"Love is something devine
falls from the heaven to earth
It expects nothing for it  but
It renders everything to others including itself
Love never ends in lust but
it grows as affection and respect
Lust expects to exploit others
to satisfy it's needs
Matured love becomes grace
lust may not be so
Lust spoils the character and life
when it develops as aggressive
Love never feeds the violence but
Lust grows in violence and feeds violence
To my Younger generation!
have a love to smash the lust
Pave the way to peace  and
take this world to that end"

Lust for you with my whole being
Long for you to hold me close
Longing and lust my lover.
Desire your arms about me
Deep within me I quiver
Don’t deny me your loving
Deep desire you just cant deny.
Touch me so gently
Taste my want so strong
Tremble my body now lover
Touch, taste and tremble"
lust,"Bizarre déité, brune comme les nuits,
Au parfum mélangé de musc et de havane,
Oeuvre de quelque obi, le Faust de la savane,
Sorcière au flanc d'ébène, enfant des noirs minuits,
Je préfère au constance, à l'opium, au nuits,
L'élixir de ta bouche où l'amour se pavane;
Quand vers toi mes désirs partent en caravane,
Tes yeux sont la citerne où boivent mes ennuis.
Par ces deux grands yeux noirs, soupiraux de ton âme,
Ô démon sans pitié! verse-moi moins de flamme;
Je ne suis pas le Styx pour t'embrasser neuf fois,
Hélas! et je ne puis, Mégère libertine,
Pour briser ton courage et te mettre aux abois,
Dans l'enfer de ton lit devenir Proserpine!
Unslakeable Lust
Singular deity, brown as the nights,
Scented with the perfume of Havana and musk,
Work of some obeah, Faust of the savanna,
Witch with ebony flanks, child of the black midnight,
I prefer to constance, to opium, to nuits,
The nectar of your mouth upon which love parades;
When toward you my desires set out in caravan,
Your eyes are the cistern that gives drink to my cares.
Through those two great black eyes, the outlets of your soul,
O pitiless demon! pour upon me less flame;
I'm not the River Styx to embrace you nine times,
Alas! and I cannot, licentious Megaera,
To break your spirit and bring you to bay
In the hell of your bed turn into Proserpine!
— Translated by William Aggeler
Sed non Satiata
Strange goddess, brown as evening to the sight,
Whose scent is half of musk, half of havanah,
Work of some obi, Faust of the Savanah,
Ebony witch, and daughter of the night.
By far preferred to troth, or drugs, or sleep,
Love vaunts the red elixir of your mouth.
My caravan of longings seeks in drouth
Your eyes, the wells at which my cares drink deep.
Through those black eyes, by which your soul respires,
Pitiless demon! pour less scorching fires.
I am no Styx nine times with flame to wed.
Nor can I turn myself to Proserpine
To break your spell, Megera libertine!
Within the dark inferno of your bed.
— Translated by Roy Campbell
Sed Non Satiata
Dusky as tropic nights, O bizarre deity,
Redolent of havana, musk and cordovan,
What obeah man or Faust of the Caribbean,
Wrought you, child-witch of night, with flanks of ebony?
Better than opium or Constanta. Wine or Nuits,
Your nectar mouth where Love swoons in a slow pavane,
When my desires set forth, a serried caravan,
Your eyes are the twin wells where I can slake ennui.
From out these wide black eyes which are your spirit's vent,
Heap fires less fierce upon me. O impenitent,
I am no tireless Styx to gird you nine times nine,
I am no lustful Fury to exhaust your lust,
To break your vigor or to make you bite the dust
Or in your bed's hell turn into a Proserpine.
— Translated by Jacques LeClercq
Sed Non Satiata
Strange deity, brown as nights,
Whose perfume is mixed with musk and Havanah,
Magical creation, Faust of the savanna,
Sorceress with the ebony thighs, child of black midnights,
I prefer to African wines, to opium, to burgundy,
The elixir of your mouth where love parades itself;
When my desires leave in caravan for you,
Your eyes are the reservoir where my cares drink.
From those two great black eyes, chimneys of our spirit,
O pitiless demon, throw out less flame at me;
I am no Styx to clasp you nine times,
Nor can I, alas, dissolute shrew,
To break your courage, bring you to bay,
Become any Proserpine in the hell of your bed!

pillow my head on your chest...
to throw all worries back...
with a happiness taking a nap while you hugging me...

lust,"Are you in lust with the world and all its glory?
Are you caught up in fantasy, some fairy- tale story?
Do you live for the moment and crave after feeling,
Self-Satisfied lust, the world keeps on dealing?
This material world, for which we strive,
says 'Get all you can, while your still alive.'
'Claim those riches, and build up a treasure,
go for the gold, yes, money is pleasure.'
I'm sorry my friends, but I must break your hearts,
those riches will stay, when your body departs.
'The love of money, is the root of all evil.'
If you trust in possesions, Salvation is feeble.
Don't let the world, throw you a curve,
it's either God or money, only one to serve.
Cause serving two masters, it can not be done,
pure satisfaction comes from serving God's Son.
For a camel shall pass through a needle before,
one who loves money, will see Heaven's door.
Stop concerning yourself, how the rest will react,
you may loose some friends, it's a well known fact.
Stand up proud, let the worldly see us,
that we're seeking the riches, to be given by Jesus.
These things that you glory in and love with a passion,
can't even compare, to our Heavenly  Manison.
So lay up your treasures, not here on this Earth,
but build them in Heaven, for a spiritual worth.
You've got to take that lust and turn it to love.
Start craving the things from God up above.
The things Heaven offers, are oh-so much better,
fix your eyes up on Jesus and be a Go- Getter."
lust,"A love so secret, veiled and dark,
Hidden deep within my heart.
Yet I think I may be wrong
About my heart, my love, my song;
Is it naught but lustful yearning?
A base desire my heart is learning?
Is it love or is it lust?
To find the truth I think I must;
Search my black and tattered soul,
And make the truth my one true goal,
Until at last my colours show.
But, I guess, till then I'll never know."
lust,"Thoughts of you, how my temperature rises
Your body next to mine so divine
Your touch electric upon my skin
Lost in the lust of our connection.
When we meet my body is alive
My control is abandoned to you
Nothing can equal the feelings I have
I’m lost in my lust for you.
Into a world of pure desire
We are locked together
United we feel the flow
Touch, taste, explore.
Lost to Lust"
lust,"My heart beats faster as I almost expect you to be there,
As I look for you for, for  your eyes, for your lips, for your touch.
My skin yearns for you, for your fingers to linger across my chest.
My lips need your soft tender kiss. I can't keep doing this I can't stop doing this, I need this, I need you. I.. need.. you. This thing, this yearning, this lust, I need."
lust,"Each shall have a room, as they are distinct
As love is blind, lust has eyes wide open for its games
As love is day, lust is the night at the bar
As love speaks the truth, lust can just lay silent looking for the tasty froth
Love need not be beautiful but lust makes it a requisite
Love may abstain, but lust cannot
By its nature it thrives in banquets
Love is pure but lust goes to mud in all wild wrestling for what it desires
I can love you without lust
But you may not like it after all
I love and lust you
And in you
Love and lust shall
Hold hands, kiss tight, hiss all the night
Love and lust
The two becoming one
To both of us
So this union may last
This communion of souls."
lust,"Gazing upon the turquoise-beaded necklace
Of a dark, mysterious Turkish girl,
A man slips into mystical ancient times
Of hidden codes and long forgotten gods,
Astrological-charted paths
Of love and destiny.

The hot sun tingles on warm skin,
Lust flows as naturally as sweat
And oozes from every pore
Breathing sensual rendezvous,
Physical encounters in barely furnished rooms,
Clothing is removed and tossed
Onto simple rugs,
Then the tasting of tongues.
Orgasmic adventures amid threats
From violently plotting parents
And a jealous suitor counting the days
To receive his intended prize
Who is expected to bleed on clean sheets
Of somebody’s defined customary purity.
But young girls all prefer rough renegades
Who joyously seize their love
That the lackluster and naive
Can never appreciate;
Girls can always return and lie
To any boy who blindly follows
The dictates of his parents."
lust,"Gnarled Lust
is a blackened tree
feasting on a murdered landscape;
having been watered by poisoned fertilizers
sprouted gray leaves
displaying a history of
driving Love's Bent;
but, more importantly, also a history of voracious greed, death, blood and atrocities,
its spread now reaches the dead vampire desire for immortality
by sucking red blood from prone victims
who crave
love, sex and death in swain's sucklings
fired of the desire to cheat death and live forever,
even at the cost of dead hand affections
and dark broodings
outside the light-
an ultimate narcissistic
confection
consumed
of poisoned drops;
of failed promises
illusioned drinkings
and bloody hands.
All there in history:
power mongers
mind killers
word demons
culture jailers
dead limp drug healers
all seeking to bury Faith alive
strangle Hope in its baby crib
all watered
under Lust's tree
and producing
millions of dead gray leaves
all embraced
reeking of the still warm blood
sucked from others.
All these in human history
seen marching
lashing the backs of slaves
of women, hapless men
of children;
an obsessed march
toward Lust's Dark Horizons
contorting history
while True Virtue
miraculously at History's Turning Point
ultimately showed its face
and started it's own march toward justice, mercy
and democracy
progress slow to be sure
but relentless
with these transfusions
now turning gray to green in some places,
and that battle
while not yet won
has been joined.
The lesson here my friend
then
is that there is a difference
between Good
and Evil."
lust,"Straight from the gutters of hell!
She blows, sweeter than sugar
She burns,  flaming desires
Consuming all our emotions
Imitating the wings of love
Exciting and breath taking
Over flowing souls with her passion
Raging with infatuation
Hungry with an obsession
Not submitting to devotion
So powerful and strong
Luscious tasty desires
Never last a lifetime
But cause some a lifetime of pain

lust,"Are stolen fruits the most exciting?
Down on you with tongue delighting
As a butterfly lands on a flower
Then rough and wild hour on hour
A voracious animal, a wild beast
Spreads you out for his feast
Uninhibited bursts of passion
So gentle a tongue, then a lashing
Mouthfuls then fingers in so deep
Sucking and licking – forget sleep!
Stop don’t stop O stop please please!
Rivers run - I’m on my knees!
You grin demented wild and free
Laughing madly in pleasure’s glee
Untamed the passion erupts to bliss
Then a wet dirty hungry kiss!
Vesuvius erupts and earthquakes roar
Howling moaning, come back for more!
In a frenzied torrent of lust and passion
Waves of a storm, downward crashing!
Slow deep and in - the thrusting goes
Till faster faster the whole thing blows!
A runaway train smashing into a station
Eruptions fly in exultation!
Full body slamming from the top
Yields a fair good splashing crop
Full body slamming from behind
You love it babe – hard and kind!
From after midnight thru till noon
Like dogs in heat before the moon!
Entangled and caught within your snare
Your touch and love are all my care."
lust,"Do you ever see me bleed? how my eyes be come so numb
How my body felt so cold and froze can't seem to move a bit
Memorise every step that we take in the affection which was true
Which never seem to break through but all that days has gone
Do you ever heard me cry out for you? in my breathless murn
In my weak heart just broke that I can't take in but to bury all that moments deep inside of me
Why does love is such a crime?
When our love was just so real?
Why would someone want a part like this?
When we knew we were meant to be
How my heart peel into pieces like a broken glass that can't  be un-do
How our feelings and the affeaction is like a drung like what you said to me onces but that last.
How  you wishper Don't worry I knew I'm gone to lost you forever
I knew my heart belonge to you but i give up and let go of you
It ain't felt right to be with you when you had someone'else but me
Left me here with my sorrow lock me up for so long felt like years that you left me here, but for sure you gone but this time is for good
But I'm the one that walk out of for real I can't bury  it inside
Goodbye to you  my love, LOve  Is just like a lust
Giving up on you love Isn't easy
It ain't easy to forget you for sure that is real
It ain't easy to say it to you like this on the telephone
Felt the numb in my weak heart hopeyou hear me for the last
BUt yOU knew how much I LOve you
From my heart and soul which is true
It break my heart to say this way
But can't see it how hard it is for me to say this"
lust,"I make my way, through the heavily treed,
leaf covered path, I suddenly see you.
You're standing there, surrounded by wild flowers.
Behind you, a small stream, trembles it's way down
the mountainside. You are so radiantly beautiful,
I overflow, ache with love for you. No words are
spoken. I find myself bursting, for want of your love.
For the need to hold you...touch you.
Slowly, we make our way toward each other.
We meet amid a bed of soft, green moss.
Our hands reach out, touch, and as if in
slow motion, we find ourselves seated
on this bed of Gods making. Your lips
are moist, my heart pounding. Your breath
quickens, as the rise and fall of your full
breasts seem to try to free themselves.
I'm am inches from those lips, I have long
for. As you move toward me, we kiss.
A long, moist, tender... hungry kiss.
A kiss, that fulfills all the promises of
love. I feel myself, melting into your very soul.
I lay you gently back on the bed of green.
You, touching the pulsating volcano
beneath my pants. I unbutton your blouse,
and free you from the thin veiled garment,
that had covered your hardened nipples.
For a brief moment, I stare at you.
Your breasts, moist with desire and your
eyes fill with love and the promise of ecstasy.
I tremble, as if a magnet, the brown circles of
desire, atop your milky white breasts, draw my lips,
to softly encircle your erect nipples.Your hands slide
behind my head, and crush my lips to your softness.
You rip open my pants, clutching the hard roundness, of
my throbbing flesh. I touch you in your most private part
and it is wet...wanting. We clutch, grab, explore
each other, like two wild animals. You open yourself
to me, and murmur, 'Now...now...please now.'
I can wait no longer, as my missile of love,
on the verge of exploding, seeks the inviting wetness,
between your legs. I can barely contain myself, then....
The phone rings. No! No! Not now!
It keeps ringing...ringing...ringing!
Keeper of dreams, I beg you...not now!
Please...not now.
The vision evaporates! I try to recapture
it. The phone, now sounding like an
alarm, persists. I have lost the dream.
I have lost...her.
Dammit! I curse the reality of the moment!
She knows, as do I, I will go to her again.
I can not give her up. For she has become
me...and I her.
Until tomorrow...or another day...or another
time...or another world.
It matters not where she is. I shall find her.
For she is my love...and I shall yet again,
go to her.

lust,"Introduction: Limit itself has a limit of its own…
A walk, mile after mile
In quest for my lost soul,
I had forgotten how to smile
Everything felt out of control,
I fought too hard to be worthwhile
By that I got lost in my life’s hole
The regrets for mistakes I’ve made
It took me off the edge, way too far away;
Yet I tried again so hard to get off from that shade
But got caught up in my brutal fray,
The same song keeps playing with such a vicious rage,
I find myself down to my knees, nowhere to go - So I pray
A prayer to leave the worst and move onto more,
Come off this fantasy and onto reality, to be -
Closer to something I’ve been fighting for
The touch of the light cutting through the night, it rains down upon me
As I overcome the grief and believe, recovery lies ashore,
Only three steps remain, to be fixed and free.
A lesson of value I earned from my faults -
Never push yourself off the edge,
You’ll lose the only key to the vault
A life you never had to live – It too could forever be lost,
So stay confined within the limits of the limit
As it seems - Your control over lust, only can make you complete."
lust,"Love awakens any age
Fifties thirties teen
Grows to strength with steady rage
Ripe emotions sown!
Lust awakens any time
Midnight noon or morn
Goes to sleep that ready time
Mad water flown!"
lust,"A mere sight
of your body,
lits me up
like a gas stove.
So Red hot
I can feel fire,
blazing urge
getting crazy.
Such feeling
can't be gentle,
demanding
this lust not love."
lust,"O Lust! you're burning holes in our affair.
We lost our brazen face without a care-
Flaunting all in front of those who scowled,
Laughing at the doleful - e'er we howled!
Ironically, our sneering turned inside
To out the damage, tear apart our pride.
We saw we'd fallen for the devil's dust!
So let's in shame the blade to take and thrust!

lust,"The lust we fought for in now just a pile of ash.
The lust we fought for was a lie to it's very last.
The lust we fought for burns in my memory every night.
The kust we fought for wasn't worth it's own right.
The lust we fought for seemed so out of control.
The lust we fought for only needed us to grab ahold.
So the lust we fought for wasn't lust at all.
Indeed it was love that made our great fall.
The lust we fought for keeps me crying at night.
The lust we fought for has me praying to turn it right.
The lust we fought for makes me miss you more.
The lust we fought for broke my heart to it's core.
The lust we fought for brings out a million tears.
The lust we fought for challenged all of my fears.
So the lust we fought for was the pain i deserved to face.
Indeed it was love from that magically beautiful place.
The lust we fought for is now gone up in flames...
Because I now know that the lust we fought for was real all the same."
lust,"What is it really?
Is it within you? ..is it
your lips wrapped
around it?
Is it in the head?
Is it in the moon?
Venus really is it?
Is it always fault of Mars..
Is it always to soon?
If it's touched..once
is it lust..ing..?
If it's touched over
and over like book
shelves is it dusting?
What if it's touched
just to hear it make
it's noise that wet noisy?
Can lust make it feint?
If streams damn a lake
runs to rivers in currents
ocean is flavor is it lust?
Is lust like dusting, out so
call the maid, ring for the
butler, man it is armed.
Over maid being dusted?
What is it, is it lust..?
Is it very sweet musk?
Is it lust to touch one smile
into another two smiles
just to cover all the smiles?
What is lust..is it need or is
it simply thick seed running,
into wells never filling, a truth?
Is lust yours simply unsealed,
mounted, covered and filled?"
lust,"The lust for power consumes men
Blinds the mind and pollutes reason
Diverts good purposes and then
Corrupts the character's condition.
The lust for power is seductive
Erodes the noble and benign
Ignores all truth, it's so destructive
Insatiable hunger is there assigned.
A dragon of three heads set free
Devours all who would come near
Lust for power grows greedily
Claws in position, breeding fear.
It lacks all sense of  decency
And by callous ardor will try to hold
The power it gained deceitfully
Ignoring Justice and Truth foretold.

lust,"eyes the color of gold
there is a story that must be told
a passionate soul that is true
could i be the one for you?
within the darkness of night there is a secret i must hide
could you be the holder of my pride?
through the paleness of life,
you will never let me bring down my knife
with you buy my side i may never die
because i make you form a gentle sigh...
you tell me i have no strife
but what is the point of immortality if you deny your self the simple pleasures in life
the immortality i declare is not the answer so beware"
lust,"Feeling restless, feeling high
This aching heat, it will never die
It consumes me so, from the inside
Wanting escape, release, be on fire.
I need to hear you breathlessly curse
And moan and sigh my name
To taste the salty sheen on your skin,
And feel every nuance of your passionate embrace
Tell me with your body how much you need me,
Tell me with each thrust how desperate you are
I want to hear your crazy erratic heartbeat
To slowly melt in your heat as you feel me
To taste our sinful essence on your tongue
Entangled in my mouth like you can't get enough.
Throw me on the bed of lust, consume me,
I want you to make me lose myself completely."
lust,"The world knows it and yet falls in this swamp,
Though knowing well one can’t come out alive;
Lust works its charms and you feel you are champ,
But stings to death like swarm of bees from hive.
Lust comes to man like dreams enjoyable too,
But leaves a tired frame and heart of guilt;
Until you fall a victim, lust holds you,
And there-after, the vice will stay in-built.
Lust blinds the eye that used to see true love,
And leaves a man both sick in mind and heart;
If not steady, it can any heart move,
And keeps the soul sinful, till you depart.
No God of love can in a soul such dwell,
Lust grows like cancer, taking soul to Hell.

lust,"When on Vedas I concentrate,
Human passions come in spate;
From the Vedas take me away,
On my mind they hold sway.

Lust comes to me as a wild fire,
I am astounded with base desire(s):
Like a savage it lives at the root,
Am I a man or am I a brute?
****
But sapling of life from it sprout(s) ,
On its maturity love is the fruit;
Lust as seedling dissolves in dust,
Soon my love flowers in trust.

Its sweet fragrance removes disgust,
My whole world brightens up robust;
It is the basis of home and hearth,
In it lies all my mirth and worth.
***
Then it builds new castles of trust,
Thus I pass on from trust to trust;
Call it vicious or girdle girth,
Thus I wander birth to birth."
lust,"Tho' you crush the fang
Of an erratic, cunning cub,
Wandering in shadow
Trickling spittle for blood,
Without leniency in eyes,
He'll be disrobing a deer's spirit,
Again, by the lust of his hunger."
lust,"With padded feet from out his own dark den
Comes smiling Lust, once fair and hard to
please,
But now long overworked with dabbling men,
Who cry, 'We've tasted this and tired of these.'
Pausing in doubt, suspecting some defence,
He stares with eyes blue-lidded, at the Shape,
Then stooping, whispers low of innocence,
Of waiting chastity and sweetest rape.
With hairless hands awave, lisps reeking tales
'Mid smothered sighs, acquivering the while
he sees a horrored frown and fears he fails,
But smiling much whene'er he sees a smile.
Then pressing, 'Flesh is this, they needed food,'
And, 'Flesh is warmest in its stolen blood.'"
lust,"Lust, a burning, searing flame
that creeps through your veins.
Lighting you up with a hot,
fiery passion, it moves ever so quickly.
A feeling to love or hate,
It makes you feel so alive.
It is a sin, a lovely yet...
deadly sin, burning ever so fast.
Lust is love, lust is passion
Lust is many things...
Yet it is mainly just,
what it is, lust..."
lust,"Blood dripping from the fangs
that bite
Clothed within the dark
of night
Discarded prey dropped
out of sight
The Vampire stood
Nightly ventures from
his lair
Cruel dark eyes that hold
and stare
Tempting humans
unaware
The Vampire waits
Shadowed by the
trailing leaves
An unsuspecting
victim weaves
The living heartbeat soon
to grieve
The Vampire stalks
Under the cold dark
waning moon
One maiden's blood has made
him swoon
Though undead sleep will
claim him soon
The Vampire feasts
Cursing his old
immortal soul
He dreams and wishes
he were whole
Even in death, life takes
its toll
The Vampire sleeps
Sunset comes in the blink
of an eye
Announcing an already
menacing sky
Savouring the mortal
about to die
The Vampire wakes."
lust,"the days when liking someone was so simple and meaningless
like someone for no reason, or purpose
you like the way the looked
you liked the way the acted
they were nice to you one, or twice
you know its going no where
but you like them anyways
for no good reason
you see them once or twice a day
you see them in school
you keep it a secret, only your best friend knows
people ask you all the time 'who do you like'
and you only reply 'nobody! ! '
any you get frustrated, and embarrassed
and when your pathetic secret is revealed
you cry in the halls in embarrassment
and run away
young lust
such a pathetic excuse for love..."
lust,"Trecking in from the wind,
Is a beauty so joyful,
She begins to sing,
Also very playful,
My babe is under my wing.
We fly away when the time is necessary,
Rain or shine
We glide so high,
Feeling safe which is a necessity,
No one can deny or intefere which is why,
we float in extacy,
Bleeding through our veins,
Running deep in our blood,
Is more we could gain,
With a added bonus for a lust for love."
lust,"Love can be
A miracle surprise
Beaming from
A stranger’s eyes
Whom you meet
On a city street
While the stars
Are dancing around
Her angelic soul
Hypnotizing and
Mesmerizing you
Into psychic rapture;
You take her hand
And walk to the beach,
The beautiful music
Of seashells jangling
Provide the soundtrack
For seduction,
Her small earrings
Beckon your mouth
To kiss and nibble
The ears they adorn,
Her body is warm
As you excitedly inhale
Her perfumed breath of lust,
You’re pleasantly paralyzed
With ecstatic joy!"
lust,"Are you blind or eyes were gone
In lust or many more
To grab the dust of grass
Filling your never ending desire
Craving for nothing that you deserve
And why I am suppose to die
Upon you unholy feet
Love is dead
On the day this face was smudged with your lies
Calling no name and I know one
Dear heart was broken and I must get you forsaken
Until the end of time!"

lust,"Day in, day out, we  spend precious time together
Talking and sharing things which interest each other
Night in, night out, we stay in touch
Loving each other, we feel this much.
In every talk we have, you play such a role
Amazingly giving me hints to toss a ball
You help me play BOLO chess, be on the look out it means best
And I guess you’re a perfect buddy I will have than the rest.
We cannot live a single day not seeing each other
Saying passionate words we do in hours; never tire and bother.
I always blush, you do too, as we bite our lips
With every romantic and lustful words as we both sexily tease.
I love the way we love each other, strong and deep
We make the hours worthwhile as we heartily keep
Longing and missing are tolerable each day
Because we know at this moment it’s the only way.
I love the way I lust with you, oh Hon, I do
Sensible and respectful, embracing it, nothing to undo,
We know we need to wait patiently until we can fulfill
The completeness we want to have so much in real."
lust,"Wake me up from this dream,
Nothings ever as it seems.
This secret gift we do not share, leaves me wondering if you'll always be there.
You bring me up when I am down.
You make me smile when you see a frown.
Being with you is our own perfect world.
A great escape from our reality that leaves us bored.
I am yours as you are mine.
A special love thats so devine.
Through the years there will be tears.
Lots of laughter and conquering of fears.
I give you my body my mind and my soul,
your love completes me, it makes me whole.
You are so perfect in every single way.
I can't live without you not even a day."
lust,"Orange slice
inside
my mouth
zesty juicy
and
squirting sweetness
from inside out
feeding me more
succulent dreams
streaming out
from luscious

hidden behind
invisible lovers
teasing
my heart
till invading
sparkles sit
on the tip
of my tongue
with ripe
bright oranges
I slowly lap up
for more
of the same
reviving delicious
self pleasing
enjoyment on eating
a fruit as deep
as the ocean of lust"
lust,"It's like a loud gale...
scorching hundred miles an hour
leaving bruises at the brim of mother-earth

lust,"lust is a passionate desire. When I lust I cant to be tamed you think SEX but I think LIFE.......nobody can stop you from lust more you lust life more you become he who is untamed not worrying about the opinion of others but only of your own. For you are your own worst enemy, and I am that enemy that will stop at no end to defeat my offenders.

lust,"These days everybody uses word love to express his or her feeling
But the problem is majority of them don’t know the real love meaning
What real love has to do with the lust?
If you get confused between love and lust, you are going to pay the price, whatever the cost
Remember, one of the most important part of your life is your feeling
So, when it comes to the real love, you better watch out with whom you are dealing
Real love requires sacrifices, respect, caring, forgiveness and trust
If you attracted to someone solely for your looks, that’s not the love, that’s a pure lust
This poem has a message especially for young people and teenage
Because lust, not the real love is the most popular one at this age
You can easily involve in a bad relationship
If every time someone claims, that loves you and you give away your heart so easy and so cheap
unfortunately, the teenage girls are the most victims of the lust
So, you better get your college degree first, then you mature enough to know, when it comes to real love, who you should trust"
lust,"I want your body, I want your mind
I want you with me all the time,
I pull you close, I feel a shiver
this puddle of lust, is now a river,
your lips are parted and ready for me,
our lips come close and brush gently,
I look into your eyes...you tell me your ready,
I kiss down your neck, bieng very steady,
You tell me stop teasing......but your pleasure will grow
Our loves blossoming with every touch, She's screaming with pleasures that she needed so much.
Her body writhing from the gift that has been given.
She lie there enthrawled in ecstasy, she grips my arms and kisses me,
she whispers 'better than my fantasy'
I kiss her neck and hold her tight..
and whisper back 'id hoped I'd do it right'"
lust,"The heavens may forget
that lovers sit on idle haunches
waiting for the stars to fall
for lust to make manifest.
The lovers may forget
that heaven, unlike earth,
gives not strength to fools
who would lust make manifest.
The fortunes of fools
my rest on her breast
the fate of nations
may lay in his hands
but lust, oh lust,
to it, who would entrust
the power to turn a man
from steel to dust."
lust,"What is the night's remorse if not the regret of your lips gone from mine?
Is it the moon mocking the sun in its endless game of chase?
Where, for but a moment, they are lovers joined then just as quickly receded.
Is it that you are to be the water to end this endless thirst for love?
Or am I to be the drug that torments you until you wake sweaty and full of need?
Would I that my dreams ceased to be haunted by your sultry eyes and wicked lips.
Would I more that those same eyes and lips tantalize me while I wake.
Could it be the tenor of your voice that soothes me  when I ache?
Or is it that my softness drives your soul to return nightly to mine?
What is your remorse if not the regret of leaving me satiated, yet not?
I reply that is the sweet sadness of loving what you can never have."
lust,"Entranced by the jewels of youth
when mischief rules our minds,
and hormones raging, so uncouth,
our eyes upon behinds,
I fell for you, in tender storms
that swelled, beyond the fly,
a promise of what might  be,  resting on the thigh,
And yet
As you raised your staff upward, towards the sky,
the dawning of my vision cleared,
and now I merely question...
What was I thinking?"
lust,"Well designed hearts
In the sands in deserts
Drawn by the fingertips
Of the so-called lovers
Crossed on the curves
To stay forever together
Supposedly on the hills
Indicating infatuated manners
Devotion kindlings set fires
In the souls in return
Naked flames of romance
Which swallows faithful lovers
Blessedly eternal
May be sometimes blaze or shimmer
Brightens the life
As it rise heart horizon in heavens
Breeze waltz with grains of the sand
And flames in summers
Flames are flared
Patterns are vanished in second
Do unveil that breeze
To find its real face which differs
Its elapsing time
As imposter of wind on the earth
Passing time substantiates
love claims if real"
lust,"And spending a lot
Over cosmetics, costumes and gyms
Beside being on diet,
Can you define life
Without lust for any?

lust,"With-in my mind
I make the scenario,
this dance of devious temptation.
thus, I then lust for you.
with precision I make you
do my minds bidding.
I crave it,
thus, I lust for you.
Placating with steps
I tip-toe your body
through my mind,
and its progressions
make me Lust for you
I make you twist to my plans.
I make you mold to me.
This dance of devious temptation,
thus, I lust for you.
In closing I plead with you
to let me act,
to let yourself sin with me.
Thus, my lust comes real."
lust,"Some say they believe in
love at first sight…
I scoff at those who see the
truth in this.
Love is an acquired thing,
you can't love someone you just
laid your eyes upon.
Lust, on the other hand is an
instantaneous thing,
an almost life threatening thing.
Lust causes babies and disease,
It is hard to tell the difference
Between the two…Love? Or lust?
That is something you will know when it happens,
Love doesn’t come easily, Lust does."
lust,"If beauty is only skin deep as they say
Into your body I would find a way.
I would pull out the beauties that
you have locked up inside
Beauties that you try to hide.
You would be the bread and I would be the jam
And I would cover you every way I can.
I would be on you like white on rice
And do everything nasty, but nice.
I would love you from the bottom
of your feet to the top of your head
You’d be so worn out, you would think
That you was dead.
Lovemaking can be vulgar or as beautiful as can be
It will bring you to a point of ecstasy.
The excitement will make your body sweat
Better than that it can’t get.
Human lust- human desire
There is only one thing that
Can put out this fire.
To fill that crave- to fill that need
Until you dropp that little seed.
And when that happens a child is conceived.
A child is born because of this desire
And then it ignites another fire.
A fire to protect this child so rare
Now that you have it with someone to share."
lust,"May I assume your ladyship waits
To be serviced before high noon?
If we off and toddle to bed right now
You may conclude your lust quite soon
Do I infer my Noble Sir
That ye seek companionship now?
Is it me ye seek to share your bed
Or wud it suffice a cow?
May I presume my dear madame
Your chatty lugubrious prattle
Betrays your lonely look of love
And desire to be my chattel?
Sir, your ubiquitous pomp and puffery
Could lay waste to my haste today
You'll be left with a swell in yur britches
A considerable price to pay
Madame, I now deduce that very soon
You may kick me in the shin
And kindly find me a big buffoon
Your company for me to win

You will find me there"

With prattle unheard of here
With tittly tattle questions of service
My prowess for I have no fear
Twice a Buffoon My Dear Sir Buffoon
Your proclivity to serve me well
Failed forthwith in it's effect
When on my bed ye fell
Perhaps Madame just recompense paid
To wit I could be led
To your just end be serviced
A reciprocity on thy bed

About there is new game

And she can't sleep
Lonley nights
Horrid fights
Pain wahses over but scars don't heal
What you give me is what i feel
Come and hold what  you can't catch
Want to know who is best?
I will show you what to see
All you have to do is trust me
Three words of passion dont mean much
When all you want isnt love
Dont use me or bruise me
whats mine is mine
And im willing to let it shine
With what i have and what i need
It's ok when you have speed
A few times you won't rememeber
Tonight or tomorrow
Let go of your sorrow"
lust,"Today i realised
lust is not lust
i must not be fussed with lust
because i have a big bust
Lust isnt what it seems
a hierarchy of beems
what does it deem to be?
not what it seems
I had lust at my breast
through that meaty chest
i did my best
but lust took my breast
under the breast lies thy heart
lust has to wonder along that part
it broke my heart
i siezed the day"
lust,"The lust for power and money to corruption lead
And some cheat and lie to satisfy their greed
And big Corporations do not have a soul
The avarice that afflicts them their thinking control.
The distribution of wealth as ever seems so unfair
And thousands grow poorer for every new millionaire
Oil tycoons and arms dealers make millions every day
Whilst thousands are dying of hunger like flowers in decay.
To be born of poor parents is their only crime
And they look thin, old and gray though only in their prime
In refugee camps they are forced to reside
In a Land ravaged by drought and by war men destroyed.
'Tis true power can be a corruptible thing
Of the wealthy and famous some poets only sing
Why laud people who have far more than enough
When millions are homeless and have to sleep rough.
The lust for power seems to be thriving of late
And only the wealthy and famous the media celebrate
Whilst each day thousands die of hunger doesn''t life seem unfair
In a World where empathy and compassion are rare."
lust,"You glance over and smile,
A smile just for me,
I return it.
But I wish yours,
Meant the same as mine.
There's a hidden passion,
I can't let out.
I have to hold back,
My body screams for you,
I can't get you off my mind.
I wanna be more than friends,
I wanna be everything for you,
But I don't know how you feel.
So I've got to keep it,
To myself,
My secret lust."
lust,"The lust wounds
the flesh kills
deceit of temptation appeals
what shield hides
if weakness reveals?"
lust,"Lust means luxuria, lechery, lasciviousness and sensuality.
Lust means intensive desire for sexual pleasure,
A taboo of the sixth commandments.
Lust is nothing but power, most aphrodisiacal.
Lust is carrying women in thought.
Lust is substituting prostitutes.
Lust is marrying and sustaining a family,
Putting up with children crying,
Overdoing themselves in explanation of lapses,
Looking at women they like to move around,
Buying expensive clothes for themselves,
Gifting valuables to women they have crush on,
Paying attention to woman other than their wives
To make up what was missing
Without knowing what it is.
In a nut shell, lust is in every action.

to hug you to my chest so strong...
and to start kissing you...
kissing you with my thirsty lips...
which missed you sooo...

A beauty that has swiped two souls,
One soul wiped by true love,
The other soul is snaped by lust..

Hope that breeze winded desirous cupidity,
Love scopes spirits relently in  bedevil ways,
Rays of burden burns me deep emotionally,
Emotion is deleterious upon (weepy)     hearts,
Heart is ferociously >attacked< with fake love,
Holler of vociferation utterance has left me killed...

depends upon the person u love"
lust,"My body yearns for you, craving your hungry touch.
Igniting a fire within me I never wanted you so much.
My passion continues to bulid, You take me to the very top
Lost in sheer ecstacy, I never want you to stop.
Waves and waves of pleasure coarse through my  hungry veins
Escalating me even higher, the animal so hard to tame.
You play my body like an instument, a genius at your craft
Strumming with delicate ease, every note right on it's path.
Climbing even higher, we finally reach the peak.
Hanging  on with all my might, I can harldy speak.
My body starts to tremble and shake with pure delight.
Traveling to pleasure land, what a way to spend the night"
lust,"I hear the words you say to me
I see the way you look at me
I know whats on your mind
At one time you were settled
down in mine
It's not the things you say to me
it's simply the way you look at me
Hard for me to look at you, into
the eyes of the one I could be
drawn to
We had the chance and
you stopped, you realized
what was true
That it was only an illusion,
a desire that we both share
something we both know
we can't allow to be true
Time has passed now and
it's starting again
But we can't let this happen
I've come to far now to sin
But your bold more confident now
you hang around like before
hoping to talk, to get me alone
the same way it started before
I can't let this happen but I don't
know if I could, addiction is only
lust it's about what feels good
So I'll back off because I don't
want to fail and the destruction
this would be, trust me I know a
thing or two about 'earthly hells'."
lust,"The feel of your teeth
On my ear lobe,
Your nails
Raking a trail of red
On my back.

The slippery tango
Of our tongues.

Our nips and nibbles
All over,
Leaving no spot
A virgin

My hungry mouth
Ravishing,
The source
Of your elixir.

The not so gentle
Assault
Of your tongue
On my pride,
Pushing me to the edge…

As you pull me
Into you
Like a predator
Your eyes
Dilate
Like a victim’s.

Hard,
Soft;
Holding back,
Letting go;
Pleasure,
Pain;
Satiation,
Hunger….

The paradox
Of lust –
An eternal enigma."

Passion marks and intimate sparks
Warm wet spots and warm long darts
Lust
Thoughts of “the other” permeate your daily activities
Embraces feel better than sensual encounter
Togetherness, and admiring all of your mate
Love
These terms might lead in
Freaky
Nasty
Tasty and sneaky
If it’s not present from the line read above
Check the actions and intention if you really know the difference between Lust and Love"
lust,"I once had a secret crush
People say it must be lust
they don't know the way i blush
This man is so kind
He will really blow your mind
i think of him every night
This crush just wont leave me
and i don't really know why
Maybe one day, the feelings will be free
and i wont have you to see
I want to make him understand
the way i feel for him
I want him to be my man
I don't really want to push it
But after that really long kiss
I could no longer resist it
it is every thing i wanted
I love him so very much
But I feel I will mess up
If I tell my secret crush.
I don't know if he will understand
my love for him it real
My love for you is secret
I weep when we are apart
If I open up my heart
It would rip our friendship apart
So I'll keep my love a secret
A secret of the heart.

lust,"Peeping at porno
downloaded three years ago
and not seen since
a horse and a woman
of course
so big
mine not even close
but besides that
what?
in his beating heart
what?
the unbearable delight
the same
trembling flesh entering Paradise
and agony later, if corruption seeps in.
Ah!
that magnificent stallion
manifesting the universal maneuver
all beings were born into
but I tell you
from the bottom of my heart
I want only
the serene camaraderie of distant stars
and their unimaginable burning
in eternal fire
until the final act of creation
collapses into a black hole
sucking both memory and revelation
into absolute gravity
and now the naked woman
flashes her Technicolor breasts
the horse high and ready for the next scene
don’t want to see it
not anymore
the Buddha sad
I ever sought such desire
or any desire."
lust,"In loving someone,
I cannot tell,
The thought of lust,
A continous bell,
Kissing and touching,
Is this really love?
Could we live without it?
Is it something we're above?
Do we need the touch of another,
The caress of his lips,
Those warm arms around us,
When the cold winter nips?
Could we deny pleasure,
Or is that all we are?
And if we went slower,
Would we really go far?
Would we hold on forever,
And never let go?
Or aren't you here forever?
These questions I must know.
For if you're here for love,
I'll love you till I die,
But if your here for only lust,
Im sorry, goodbye."
lust,"A Flurry of texts hot talk and sex charged environments can have adverse effect causing defects in the heart and soul lasting till you grow old regrets beget sadness that's an easy way of slipping into madness but i digress from the point of this there is none not a single reason for this a sickness so seductive never wanting to miss a second of each sweet kiss a love drunk bliss until words fly like imaginary fist's and heart's are pummeled"
lust,"They say
Death is not what it seems
It does not replace the screams
in your dreams
It does not resolve those problems
that linger along with dread
All these years Ive had
of hate
of rage
of pain
of sorrow
With one swift movement
I could no longer be here for tomorrow
and I laugh at all the saints
because they know of all this hate
if death never solved
the desires we have
or took away our pain
Then why do so many
end thier lives
because of all their hate
Why do people run
and fear it
When death is nothing but a limit
I could, could take my life today
to show these people
How Im made
To prove them wrong
to watch them cry
Blood lust
is not a crime
and as i lay here
dabating my fate
you all laugh
and scream out
'what a fake! '
But wait and see
for I am me
and the things I think
are not what you may seem
so once again
I point and sing
blood lust
is not a crime
Now what do you think!"
lust,"If it’s lust or love
nobody will ever know
and the night in front of the hot fireplace
I cannot forget easily
and still both are at times
part of what is in a relationship
between two people.
Strangely the lust eats me
were I stand almost naked
at the fireplace
and small john,
tries to stand just as upright
and big as big john.
There are flames from the fireplace
flashing in your eyes
when I take my underpants off
and your white face
is suddenly strangely pure,
while the inner fire
eats both of us
and the nipples of your big breasts
erect and prominent
almost magically draws my fingers.
Your mouth is hot,
soft and sweet
and your body
better to play with
that the strings of a guitar
and there are passion that abate in us
and when I disappear in your depths
there’s pleasure that at times
builds and subsides
and later we both
hit the right chord"
lust,"sail with me
on my boat to the sea
your breasts my paddles
my pelvis your floor
sail with me
in the ocean of desire
lust with me
on this little leak of my
boat to the sea
sink with me
to the deepest thoughts
of the sea
learn with me
the meaning of love
the true meaning of true love
death of desire
rising at the end
to the greater joys of foam
at the surface
the sun, the moon and then the stars"
lust,"Never intended for it to happen
I had an itch that needed to be scratched
Guess I liked the physical and mental aspect of it
and it required no commitment
It's nothing that I've fantasize of
and yeah it was empty and unsatisfying
But, it's definitely worth doing at least once in a lifetime
Could never imagine the fact
That I would be giving away myself to another
in a way that should be giving to someone special
Having been caught up in a moment of intense passion
at the time it felt right
Though, it was one big mistake I've made
I'd be one to admit that... it's more interesting in a relationship
went against all I believed in... and it made me feel guilty
just didn't feel meaningful to me nor was it satisfactory in anyway
every minute I regreted it, but, apart of me wanted it so desperately
Yes... an incident, I don't ever want to relive again
Yeah, it was a mutual feeling between two people
who only wanted to have fun for one night
still, I have to be honest... I wasn't amazed
Nor did it blow my mind, the whole experience dissatisfied me
Would I be seen as cheap or would there be lack of respect for me?
I only acted on a feeling... and it's something all humans do
ain't that apart of being human?
Dealt with breakup that hurts so bad, I found solace when I was sad
just was the way I choose to deal with the pain that I feel"
lust,"The lust for power is an addiction the Government their own praises do sing
And rubbish their main opposition as to Government they try to cling
The voters bombarded with propaganda right up until election day
The true fact of all politicians is they seldom do mean what they say
The winners take all of the glory and the winners they do celebrate
The prize it is great and worth lying for that's how they feel those who wish to rule the State
The lust for power is an addiction and not a harmless addiction 'twould seem
Without such power some people feel worthless and suffer of low self esteem
Some people become so power hungry that power to their egos is fuel
They feel it is their right to Govern that they have been born to rule
The Opposition as bad as the Government they too want power in the worst way
Any respect to their political opponents they have no desire for to pay
It is all about power and their egos power to them is the best thing of all
Their pride to them is all that matter though pride it can come before a fall."
lust,"There is no love or lust
it is body hunger and must
there is nothing like love or attachment
it is pure mechanism for adjustment
Who can define it as pure lust?
can any one claim its purest form
when he or she is not readily informed?
it is purely need that is legally transformed
i wish to condemn all on that name
we can definitely over come it and rename
love or lust grows with time and age
we are simply bonded in  cage
it is fine name given by literary world
we simply blow hot and cold
let there be open soul search?
no one may come forward with his research
it is purest form of love if we can understand
it may mushroom in any form with wife or husband
how do you over come  some short comings?
that is fine phase with new innings
life is nothing new but a bad or good phase
we love to play it and still face
All possible criticism with no fun fare
No one is possible cautious or aware
let us not wrap it in beautiful cover
it existed before and may remain forever
no one has escaped and may not do so in future
this fact must be realized for sure
we are human beings and may react strongly
this is wrost represntation with face so ugly
it is pity we ignore the  universal  fact
it may remain forever as matter of fact
we may strongly disprove
we may try nice point to prove
the world may take note of it but remain unmoved
the misgivings must  at any cost be removed"
lust,"My lust for you is like a fire
All it does is burn
It burns everything in sight
My lust for you is intense
All I do is think about you
The way you smell
The way you look
All I do is think about you
That's my lust for you."
lust,"My kisses miss your sweet kisses; and when I'm lonely, I
yearn for your open arms. Now, my life is an anathema,
hardly worth the mention nor open for debate. No great gem
ever glows without the light. When the moon shines over sea,
a particular thing happens, the moon makes magic while shining down.
Rivers run into the heart. Everything whispers of love; and a
tidal wave of desire rushes through the soul. A blushing cheek
is kissed by silken lips, open in amorous affection and love.
Sweet effluence of the night! Universe of stars! I am embraced
in the arms of eternity, clinging to the pleasures I keep,
never knowing if or when he will suddenly disappear with the
yellow lantern of the moon. My breasts mingle with the sea -
orphic nipples on azure ripples, echoes of ecstasy; and the nebular
universe may stop turning but the heart blossoms like the soil.
Ravenously hungry, it desires more - always deeper than the sea - so
hungry for an undying love, searching calmly and so certain of
a never-ending triumphant bliss. The heart is like a pearl -
naked in length and girth - enjoying the moist and wet milieu.
Discover this pearl of love. Make metaphors move magic within us,
salaciously sliding into my sex, erupting in scarlet lips of lust.
Among this treasure of words, the reader, upon close examination, will discover three “hidden” messages. The first letter of each word down the left column forms the message: “My heart is in your hands.” In skimming down the right column at the last letter of each line, the reader finds the title, plus a few more words: “I am a naked pearl of lust.” Each line contains eleven words with the middle word being the sixth word. The first letter of each sixth word forms the third message: “Know me, touch me, taste me.'"
lust,"i have seen the fullness of the glory of
the front
i am awed
my mouth gaped
my saliva flowed
the heart has no words to say
there is marvel in every
nerve
barbaric in some places
setting aside wisdom
embracing
the moment
loving each minute
lusting that may last
for hours
thirst that never satisfies itself with
water
the hunger that cannot be filled
with the wheatness of
bread
i ask you to make the the turn
so i can see the past
the fullness of your back
the smoothness of that hidden skin
the curves that have given me the sense
of danger
but all these, beauty and desire
must prevail
there is glory everywhere
there are songs in every corner
a poem found in every slit
there are treasures shown by the maps of
every wanting
always insatiable
always unbearable."
lust,"I thought you were history when,
I heard the slam at the door!
But like the tale of two obsessions in love,
We are like the musical chairs on this love.
My son is for the sun and your mum is for the moon,
But i thought you were history when i heard the slam at the door!
And if only tears were laughter,
Then, i will be able to take you along to paradise.
I am dumped without a clue to use the glue,
But the Spirit of Satan is like the spirit of lust;
And if only the nights were days,
Then, i would be able to see your face better.
You came and took my heart away!
But if only distances were closer,
Then, i could have crossed over to meet you;
However, the Spirit of Satan is like the spirit of lust."
lust,"Be she a metal, coal or oil,
No woman is immune to combustion of lust.
Intensity and duration of flame determine.
Woman is chaste by force.
Lust and fire are consumers.

lust,"As a lad I set my eyes upon girls
With radiant faces. For a kiss?
As a youth I cast my eyes on damsels,
Who had robust busts. For a grab?
In my manhood, I was excited
By women with sturdy waist. For a bind?
Growing old, still I was drawn to their
Smartness and maturity. For a rest?
Even in my senescence, women matter
By vision, voice and words. For a diffusion?
Birth to death, ever lust persists with the man
To feed on women on many phases.

lust,"...and then i hold
on to my body part
all my senses
wakes up
active on one
objective
to please my mind
my body
another mountain to climb
i descend
i ascend to the sun
and then
i rain."
lust,"He's just too 'touchy feely'
He gets too close to me
He gets a kiss from all the girls
From six to eighty three
But I don't think he likes me
He avoids all my advances
'Cos deep down it would be a thrill
To get a priest's romances
I'm really not that jealous
Though he never meets my gaze
Perhaps he's hoping my desire
Is just a passing phase
Perhaps I should leave well alone
As a Christian woman oughta
Instead I'll try to fix him up
With my unmarried daughter"
lust,"Tequila breath, death, sex, your face.
Little dirty secrets and your young taste.
Never too scared to try what the public hates.
Showing me your naked body with no haste.
I can see the eagerness in your eye's.
I can feel the trembling in your thighs.
You'll just tell your parents lies.
No one knows the sinful lust you tried.
You stick your tongue deep inside my mouth.
Exhilerated, youve become what makes you proud.
A little piece of death inside my eye's.
Lets lock the door and make angels cry.
Sinful lust in the nude you trust.
Inner beauty, our privates our most fun.
Dont be scared, youve done it before.
So its okay, were both filthy whores.
But on the outside we seem so clean.
Sometimes things arent as they seem.
Dirty secrets for eternity.
Well wear our masks for the world to see."
lust,"Submitting to lust.
Passion and emotion combined to a rush.
A drug without a form.
The expression is revealing.
You are addicted and you want more.
You find a victim.
You release it.
But it’s still not gone.
It’s still there roaming around.
A disease without a sound.
A curse with a touch of heaven.
A gift who gives you pleasure.
A fulfilment with no border.
A need that is growing older.
This is a bliss from god or a burden from the devil’s dust.
This is what is given.
A dangerous word called lust."
lust,"A night of lust and love
Brush your lips against my neck
And so begins your siren trek
I will obey your call and beck
Am I your paladin?
With my heart do I placate
But with your eyes, you dominate
Fairest maiden, single magnate
Wield me with a passion
Let thy heart be true and clear
Let me love you without fear
Let our souls entangle, dear
Let this be the night
Thus, the stars shine in the sky
Thus, the moonstone rises high
An audience to pain's demise
Embrace your loyal knight
Gently, graze the skin with lust
You smile sweetly; vouch your trust
I then advance; a gentle thrust
A sigh of ecstasy
Tongues engage, a lustful duel
Yet, you win! Oh, how cruel...
Arch for me, my precious jewel
Be this destiny!
Eyes hold fires, raging flames
Lover's passion can't be tamed
Sinful fires! I'm not ashamed
Fury in our love!
Harsher breathing as I drive
Gods! I've never felt so alive
Our souls, now, cannot be rived
The stars envy above
Harder, deeper, slower grinds
A feeling that just blows my mind
I hiss your name and say your mine
The fire consumes us
As we thrust and grind and kiss
I call your name, everlasting mistress
You call my name in utter bliss
The climax of our lust!
A flood of light! We both explode!
We grasp each other and tightly hold!
A cry of impulse thus untold!
We collapse upon each other
Now you gently kiss my lips,
and gently, lovingly sway your hips.
I'll taste your nectar in gentle sips
We truly love one another
Disclaimer: What happens in this poem never happened to me. I only hope it one day does. This was actually a dream I had and it made an impact on me enough that I'd like to share it."
